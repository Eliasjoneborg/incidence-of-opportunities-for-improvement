## Introduction

Background

Defined as physical injury and the body’s associated response (Gerdin),
trauma is one of the primary causes for mortality and morbidity
throughout the world. (WHO) It is estimated to claim the lives of 4,4
million annually and constitutes a massive burden on the global economy.
(WHO) For every death by trauma, three patients are rendered disabled,
which significantly amplifies its social and economic impact as well as
the importance of quality trauma care.

Objectives

## Methods

Study design A retrospective cohort study was conducted, using data from
two entities: Karolinska University Hospital’s (KUH) trauma registry and
trauma care quality registry. The registries were then linked and the
incidence of opportunities for improvement were calculated for all
patients in the following cohorts: blunt multisystem, penetrating,
shock, severe traumatic brain injury, and elderly.

Setting Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Sweden. The trauma care
registry contains all patients treated at KUH trauma center since 2012
(n>21000) and the trauma care quality registry contains a subset of
those, selected for review (n>2200).

Participants Eligibility criteria and methods of selection of
participants. All patients treated at the KUH trauma center and who
agreed to a follow up by telephone at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months,
were eligible for inclusion.
