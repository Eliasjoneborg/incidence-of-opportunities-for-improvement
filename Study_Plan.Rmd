## Introduction

Trauma, defined as physical injury and the body’s associated response,[@Gerdin2015] is the leading cause of death in patients aged 45 or younger.[@GlobalStats] It is estimated to claim 4,4 million lives each year[@WHO_2019] and constitutes a massive burden on the global economy.[@GlobalStats] For every death by trauma, three patients are rendered permanently disabled,[@Trauma] which significantly amplifies the social and economic impacts of the disease as well as the importance of quality trauma care.

In trauma epidemiology, deaths by trauma are generally categorized as non-preventable, potentially preventable or preventable.[@Preventable_1][@Preventable_2] Approximately half of all traumatic deaths occur within minutes of the initial injury [@Trauma], making primary prevention the most effective way to significantly address mortality. Of deaths occuring after hospital arrival, however, a proportion are considered potentially preventable or preventable, with estimates ranging from 2,5% to 76% depending on study population, hospital maturity and measurement method. [@Preventable_5][@Preventable_1][@Preventable_2][@Preventable_3][@Preventable_6]

As the existence of preventable in-hospital trauma-related deaths is under no dispute, trauma care quality improvement is of the highest importance; two essential aspects of which are benchmarking of outcomes and multidisciplinary mortality and morbidity review boards.[@WHO_2009][@TQIP] Benchmarking of outcomes is often done by comparing outcomes across two or more of the trauma cohorts blunt multisystem, penetrating, shock, hemorrhagic shock, severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), elderly, elderly blunt multisystem, splenic and fractures.[@WHO_2009][@TQIP][@QualityBenchmarking] Multidisciplinary mortality and morbidity reviews aims to identify possibilities for improvement and implement corrective initiatives.[@MMReview]

While much is known about mortality outcomes between trauma cohorts,[@mortality][@mortality2][[@mortality3][@mortality4][@mortality5] little research has been conducted on how the incidence of opportunities for improvement varies across these cohorts. As we strive to improve the quality of trauma care, this an important gap in knowledge that needs to be addressed. We will argue that it is plausible to assume that the number of opportunities for improvements may vary between cohorts and that the result could guide us in where to focus our limited resources.

The aim of this study is hence to estimate the incidence of opportunities in the cohorts blunt multisystem, penetrating, shock, severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and elderly in the Karolinska University Hospital (KUH) trauma and trauma care quality registries and plot them as a function over time. The decision to study these cohorts was one taken in accordance with local directives and limitations to the data contained in the KUH trauma and trauma care quality registries. 

## Methods

### Study design 

A single blinded retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the KUH trauma and the trauma care quality registries. The registries were linked and the patients divided between the trauma cohorts using a complete case analysis. All data handling and statistical analysis were initially done to a simulated set of data in order to minimize bias. Thereafter the incidence of ‘opportunities for improvement’, a dichotomous proxy measure for sub optimal care, was measured, compared between cohorts and plotted as a function over time. 

### Setting 

Karolinska University Hospital is a level 1 trauma centre that manages 1300 trauma patients each year. Trauma patients are triaged in a pre-hospital setting as a priority one or two by assessing vital physiological parameters, anatomical criteria and mechanism of injury. The pre-hospital system includes a helicopter emergency medical service and three physcician staffed ambulances. The in-hospital system includes a multidisciplinary trauma team with a surgeon, an anesthesiologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a radiologist, a surgical nurse, an assistant surgical nurse, a nurse anesthetist, an emergency medicine nurse, an emergency medicine assistant nurse and a radiology nurse. Consultations and involvement with associated specializes are available around the clock. The team has immediate access to radiology, surgery, and intensive care.

The monthly multidisciplinary trauma mortality and morbidity review boards selects patients from the trauma registry using audit filters: systolic blood pressure less than 90; Glasgow coma scale less than 9 and not intubated; injury severity score more than 15 but not admitted to the intensive care unit; time to acute intervention more than 60 minutes; time to computed tomography more than 30 minutes; and death within 30 days after trauma. The board is comprised of representatives from all disciplines involved in trauma care - surgery, neurosurgery, orthopaedics, anaesthesia and intensive care, nursing, and radiology. Its purpose is to reach a consensus regarding the presence of opportunities for improvement and implement appropriate corrective actions.

### Participants 

We included all trauma patients in the KUH care quality registry between 2014 and 2021. The quality registry contains a subset of the patients in the KUH trauma registry selected for review by a multidisciplinary mortality and morbidity review board. KUH trauma registry includes all patients admitted with trauma team activation, as well as patients admitted without trauma team activation, but retrospectively found to have a new injury severity score (NISS) of more than 15. Not included in the registry are patients who trigger trauma team activation despite not having suffered a traumatic injury and patients whose solitary injury is chronic subdural hematoma. Moreover, excluded from our study are all patients aged 15 or below and all patients with insufficient data, as to render any attempt of categorization into cohorts futile.

The cohorts are defined as: blunt multisystem injury with an abbreviated injury scale (AIS) severity score of > 3 in a least two regions of the body; penetrating truncal injury with an AIS severity score of > 3 in the regions of the neck, chest, or abdomen; shock patients with a systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg; patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury (TBI); elderly patients (over 65 years of age).


### Variables 

As the primary outcome measure, the dichotomous variable ‘opportunity for improvement’ (yes/no), derived from the KUH trauma care quality registry, was used. An opportunity for improvement was considered to apply if a multidisciplinary mortality and morbidity review board have deemed it so. 

##### Potential effect modifiers

There is a possibility that patients who would otherwise be characterized as trauma patients retrospectively, namely those who did not initiate trauma team activation, but satisfied the injury severity score criterium, were subject to systematic mis- or underdiagnosis and not included in the registries as a result. As such, they may have been undertreated and may, as a group, have a lower true incidence of opportunities for improvement, then the reported one. There is also a possibility that the patients excluded as a result of having insufficient data, were systematically better or worse of than the patients with complete data.

### Measurement 

The answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the dichotomous variable ‘opportunities for improvement’ found in the KUH trauma care quality registry, was contingent on the consensus of the discussion in the multidisciplinary review board meeting. Each case is discussed thoroughly by the attending representatives as relates to: initial evaluation, initial care, reason for audit filter trigger, resource management, outcome and so forth, and a decision regarding the presence of opportunities for improvement is subsequently taken. Lastly, they discuss corrective initiatives.

### Bias

Data handling and statistical analysis was done on a step-by-step basis using simulated data until the results using the simulated data set was satisfactory. Selection bias, caused by the inclusion criteria for the KUH care quality registry and the trauma registry, is possible. 

### Study size 

We included all patients in the KUH care quality registry, collected between 2014 and 2021, resulting in 12 099 study participants.

### Quantitative variables

Five quantitative variables were used to determine cohort eligibility: age, pre hospital systolic BP, emergency department systolic BP, AIS body region and AIS severity score. They were all converted into qualitative variables, by dividing the patients into groups defined as a numerical range (eg. age 15-65). The quantitative variable NISS was used to determine eligibility to the study as a whole, and were converted into a qualitative variable in the same manner. No quantitative variables were used in the subsequent analyses.

### Statistical methods 

We did a complete case analysis of all patients in the KUH trauma care quality registry. Variables was handled and converted in accordance with the SweTrau Manual. Thereafter patients was grouped and excluded as pertains to cohort definitions, inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria listed above. Once grouping and exclusion have been successfully accomplished, the incidence of 'opportunities for improvements' was calculated in each cohort.
